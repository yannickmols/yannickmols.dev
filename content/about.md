Hi, I'm Yannick. I do data engineering.

### Me

My place of origin is Antwerp in Belgium, where I live and work. I like coding, cooking, traveling and lifting heavy things in my spare time. Challenging myself is important to me as it helps me be the best person I can be; my "motto" is productivity by challenge. I'm also a big fan of open source and prefer using the right tools for the job.

### Writing

This blog is a place for me to write about data engineering and other related topics such as machine learning and cloud computing. It's a place where I can record and share my experiences aswell as my thoughts and interests in a somewhat structured manner. 

### Work

For the past four years I've been working as a consultant at [know.bi](https://know.bi/), capable colleagues and an awesome atmosphere make it a pleasure to work there.
